# code-quiz
Thie project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application that is heavily focused on user input and timing. The user is presented with a landing page that will allow them to either begin a quiz to test their knowledge on programming or view existing high scores (which are stored locally). During the quiz, once initiated, the option will be shown a timer that displays the remaining time before the quiz is forcefully stopped and a selection of questions. Each correctly answered question will add to the user's score while an incorrectly answered question will deduct time. After successfully completing the quiz, the user will be prompted to submit their score, after which they will be taken to a page that displays existing score submissions.
